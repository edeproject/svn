evoke documentation
===================

Introduction
------------

evoke is EDE service responsible for starting and quitting desktop, including
all needed prerequisites. Also, it will autostart programs (run programs using
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/autostart-spec[autostart specification])
and behave as http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/xsettings-spec[XSETTINGS] manager.

It is usually started at EDE startup, from 'startede' script and will allow only one instance of 
itself to be running.

Options
-------

-s, --startup::
	Run in starup mode. Startup mode should be used when environment is
	starting and it will read 'ede-startup.conf' file looking for components to
	be started.

-n, --no-splash::
	Do not display splash during startup. Only usefull if in startup mode
	(given '-s' or '--startup').

-d, --dry-run::
	Only useful in startup mode (if '-s' or '--startup' are given). Mainly to test
	splash screen themes

-h, --help::
	This help.


evoke can be started with or without options. If started without options, it will behave as
XSETTINGS manager (more below).

Autostart
---------

Autostart option is used to run applications from 'autostart' directory. This directory is
usually located at $HOME/.config/autostart or, if not exists, in /etc/xdg/autostart. 

Of course, both directories can exists and evoke will run applications from both, but with one exception:
if application with the same .desktop name exists in both (and is valid desktop file), it will
be run only from prefered directory, which is $HOME/.config/autostart.

If you want some application to be run at EDE startup (implying evoke is started with '-a' option),
just copy it's .desktop file to autostart directory. Before that, make sure that .desktop file
conforms to the http://freedesktop.org[freedesktop.org] specification for Desktop Files.

If you want to disable running some application from autostart directory, you can simply delete it's
.desktop file or set this key in it:
---------------
Hidden = true
---------------
Make sure that 'Hidden' key is under '[Desktop Entry]' section.

Autostart mode can be run in two ways: safe and unsafe. Safe way ('-u' or '--autostart-safe') will
popup window with programs that should be started, from where you can chose either to 
start some of them, start all of them or to start nothing. On other hand, unsafe way ('-a' or '--autostart')
will simply run all programs without any questioning (should I say that this can be very insecure).

These options are intentionally provided so you can choose startup policy depending on your security
options.

Startup
-------

Startup option used when EDE is starting, running each component (or program) from 'ede-startup.conf'.
This file is in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/ede (usually /etc/xdg/ede) and it's main purpose is to run
EDE parts.

This configuration file is in the following form:
--------------
[Startup]
  # start_order key is used to notify evoke what to start
  # and program keys must be separated with comma (if multiple ones are given)
  start_order = program1, program2, program3 

  # theme for starting splash screen
  splash_theme = name

# now comes each value from Startup key as separate key
[program1]
  # icon is icon used in splash screen progress (it is part of splash theme)
  icon = icon1.png

  # exec is program executable to be run
  exec = program1

  # description is used to describe what is starting
  description = my cool program

[program2]
  icon = icon2.png
  exec = program2
  description = my cool second program
--------------

XSETTINGS
---------

XSETTINGS is protocol that provides a mechanism for applications to share simple configuration settings and
it is toolkit neutral.

[NOTE]
.XSETTINGS support
==================================
Not all toolkits supports XSETTINGS protocol; currently only Gtk+ and edelib apps understainds
it (as I know).
