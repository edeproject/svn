      <center><h1>Help us make EDE better!</h1></center>
      
If you like EDE, but there is this one thing that isn't just the way it should be 
- why don't you go ahead and fix it? Apart from learning new things, this will give you an opportunity to buy yourself some public goodwill and also have a good feeling knowing that you helped both yourself and countless others. <br>
<br>
<b>Here are some ways you can help EDE:</b><br>
<br>
<i>1. Send patches</i><br>
Of course, we will appreciate it the most if you get down into code and fix actual problems. EDE presently lacks developers, and we would like to delegate some work to others. Take a look at the present <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49891&atid=457858" target="_new">list of bugs</a>, also the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49891&atid=457861" target="_new">requested features</a>.<br>
<br>
<i>2. Write documentation</i><br>
As you can see, this Help is woefully incomplete. We would like to have at least a separate help page for each of EDE components, describing its functions in a reader friendly way. Existing stuff could use some proofreading, as none of us is a native English speaker. Also, the internals of EDE (functions etc.) are poorly documented.<br>
<br>
<i>3. Translate EDE</i><br>
EDE is using GNU/gettext as its l10n framework. This means that you can use popular programs such as KBabel or PoEdit to translate EDE and thus make it easier to use to speakers of your language. There is also an EDE program named ETranslate for this purpose. Just contact us and we will send you the untranslated files.<br>
<br>
<i>4. Design graphics for EDE</i><br>
If you are a skilled designer, there are many aspects of EDE that could use redesign, such as EDE Homepage or this help. Also send us ideas for: icons, themes, window decorations, program designs, wallpapers.<br>
<br>
<i>5. Talk to your friends</i><br>
It is unusal how few people knows about EDE! The fact that there was a  hiatus in development after release of 1.0 did no good to our reputation. Also, 1.0 wasn't exactly "release quality". A few people knows that EDE is themable, which leads them to believe that EDE is a Windows-clone, etc. All those myths can be dispelled by pointing out the facts in a friendly and relaxed way :) EDE has many advantages, such as speed, simplicity, and not trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the interface (something that geeks dislike, but plain users appreciate very much).<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have anything to show to us, just <a href="authors.html">drop us a mail</a>. We like to chat with EDE users!
