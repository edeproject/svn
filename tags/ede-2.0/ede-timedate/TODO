TODO with etimedate:
* calendar
- Add text box for direct date entry
- Make month and year display into Fl_Choice
- Display number of week (within current year) somewhere... (probably in 
tooltip)

* clock
- redesign clock - use bitmaps for background and possibly hands
- make hands movable with mouse

* timezones
- add city coordinates (find in evolution / kde), draw current zone on map
- make map sensitive / hotspots on city coordinates
