This is a playground for cairo integration with FLTK. 

The main idea is to bring cairo drawable functions in FLTK-land with (if possible) addition
of mixing FLTK drawing and cairo drawing in the same window.

This is possible; the only thing is that cairo stuff will be drawn on window
background; FLTK widgets will be on top of it.


Not finished
------------
Double buffering sucks (Fl_Double_Window). There is no way to cooperate with Fl_Double_Window 
(read: inheritance) and access damage regions it keeps to replace them with own (in this case 
they are part of cairo context).

The only way is copy Fl_Double_Window::flush() and changed a few bits.
