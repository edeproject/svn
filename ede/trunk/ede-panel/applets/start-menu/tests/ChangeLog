	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167758
	Thanks to Chris Lahey for the test case.

	doesn't match anything.

	Problem pointed out by Waldo.

	* menutest: don't try and run the "CVS" test :)
	
	* tests/m/result,

	should be considered allocated.

	* tests/m: test for NoDisplay=true behavious in .desktop and
	.directory files.
	
	* data/hidden.desktop,
	  data/hidden.directory: add.
	
	* data/apps.directory: add Type=Directory.

	exist - makes it easier to write new tests.

	statement, not allowed.
