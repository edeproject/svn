DESCRIPTION
-----------
ede-dialog(1) is dialog displaying utility, very similar to xmessage, kdialog and such tools and
it's main purpose it to display messages or query inputs primarily from shell scripts.

This will enable interaction with shell scripts to look very similar to interaction with any
compiled EDE application.

DETAILS
-------
ede-dialog started as 'edialog', initially written by Vedran Ljubovic in 2005 and had been planned to support
'kdialog' (similar dialog tool from KDE) options. 'edialog' was never finished so I (Sanel) took it and rewrote
it, using subset of 'kdialog' options, mostly as inspiration for command line names.

Knowing this, ede-dialog does not support additional GUI elements like menus, checkboxes and such: it is meant to
be used for quick handling from shell scripts; anything advanced from that should use straight C++ and FLTK/edelib 
combination.

Also, return values will emulate those from 'kdialog'. For example, if you use '--yesnocancel' option, ede-dialog
will show text with three buttons: 'Yes', 'No' and 'Cancel'. Clicking on 'Yes' will return 0 so it can be picked
by shell script. Similar, pressing on 'No' will return 1 and on 'Cancel' will return 2.

On other hand, using '--yesno' will show two buttons, 'Yes' and 'No' and pressing on 'Yes' yields 0 and on 'No'
yields 1. Dialogs with only one button (those with '--error', '--sorry' and '--msgbox') always returns 0.

Input dialogs ('--inputbox' and '--password') prints inserted value to stdout, allowing easy redirection from
shell. Both dialogs provides 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons, returning 0 if 'OK' was pressed or 1 if 'Cancel' was pressed.
