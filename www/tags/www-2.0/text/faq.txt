{lname: EDE looks like win9x | ede2}

Many desktop environments look like Win9x. The reason for that is easier user transition from win platform
to linux. As you probably noticed there is "two popular standards" in desktop environment look: Win9x
and MacOS (do we count NeXT ??). Configurability is the only solution to change that.



{lname: I would install it if it does not look like win9x | ede3}

We often find posts like this or something like {i: no invention}. People who sais this have no idea how much 
companies spend time and money on research for usable and good UI design. If users want invention, let as know
for your ideas, and they will be implemented. {i:No invention} is only content-less phrase. Give us content.



{lname: Why another desktop environment| ede4}

Why not. The magic of OSG (open source community) is to provide variety of products in the same field. Users
later can choose what they like, and starts to use it. Second reason is in simplicity and
{i:create-less-dependencies} approach. As you could notice, today many modern desktop environments require tons of
additional libraries to be installed, increasing disk space and chance to destroy brain nerves to get it work.
So with our simple approach, at least second issue should be minimal.



{lname: I downloaded FLTK, but EDE won't compile| ede5}

You can't compile ede from FLTK. Use efltk since it is modified FLTK.



{lname: How do I add EDE to my GDM/KDM | ede6}

This differs among various Linux distributions. Here are instruction for some
most popular distros:

Debian (and derivations): In directory /usr/share/xsessions/ create a new file
named ede.desktop with the following contents:

 [Desktop Entry] {br: }
 Encoding=UTF-8 {br: }
 Name=EDE {br: }
 Comment=This session logs you into Equinox Desktop Environment {br: } 
 Exec=startede {br: }
 TryExec=startede {br: }
 Type=Application {br: }

RedHat (and derivations): In directory /usr/share/apps/kdm/sessions/ (replace
kdm with gdm if necessary) create the file named 99EDE.desktop with the same
contents as above.

Mandrake (and derivations): In /etc/X11/wmsession.d/ create a file named 99EDE
with the following contents:

 NAME=EDE {br: }
 ICON= {br: }
 DESC=Equinox Desktop Environment {br: }
 EXEC=/usr/bin/startede {br: }
 SCRIPT: {br: }
 exec /usr/bin/startede {br: }

Suse: Do the same as for RedHat. Then edit file named --- - you will notice  a
list of window managers. Add "startede" to this list.



{lname: I am getting make errors on BSD's | ede7}

Make sure you have GNU make installed first. EDE can't be built with BSDs default make.



{lname: What is efltk| efltk1}

efltk is cvs fork of "never-released" fltk 2.0 version started by Mikko Lahteenmaki. This fork is very modified
and extended fltk with xml, net etc. support. 



{lname: What is difference between fltk and efltk| efltk2}

In short, many. See above. 



{lname: Is there any documentation for it| efltk3}

Currently no. The only documentation that can be useful is from fltk 2.0.



{lname: Project is dead or alive| efltk4}

On some sites this topic can be found. None of this is true and efltk is much alive. We use it as base for EDE,
but it's portability to other platforms, especially non unix-like can't be promised.
