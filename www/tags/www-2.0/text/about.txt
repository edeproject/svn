{h2: What is Equinox Desktop Environment ?}
Equinox Desktop Environment (shortly EDE) is small desktop environment, built to be simple
and fast. It is based on modified FLTK library (called extended FLTK or just eFLTK). 

Comparing to other desktop environments, EDE is much faster and smaller in memory space 
(EDE's window manager use less memory than xterm). 

The word {i:"equinox"} comes from the Latin for {i:"equal night"}.
The equinoxes in March and September are the two
occasions each year when the day and the night are of equal duration. For measuring the length of a day, sunrise is
the moment when the sun is half-above the horizon and sunset is the moment when the sun is half-under the horizon.
Using this definition, the length of the day (and the night) is precisely 12 hours at an equinox.
