{h2: "bad_design" is...}

...stupid name for ede team, as you could see from tooltip. Nothing smart, really.
Anyway, the reason for existance of this page is to say what is behind pages and why.

So, the page is done in pure css + xhtml combination, as many web developers around the net,
promote it as "the next future web". The reasons for that will be explained on more web development
oriented pages as {link: simplebits | http://www.simplebits.com} or excelent 
{link: dzinelabs| http://www.dzinelabs.com}.

The page is done in {i: vim - python - css - xhtml - [kill-my-ordinary-life]} combination; just to
prove that proprietary software can be replaced. Also to prove that php (perl) is not the only language
that can be utilized with css.

That is it for now.
