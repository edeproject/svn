{title: EDE on Zaurus}

of efltk to version 2.0.6. Details about both can be found in their changelogs

{title: RFC for 1.1 version}

On {link:forum|http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1561701&amp;forum_id=249616}
is placed some sort of mini pool for the next version. See it and leave some comments.
At least we will know in which part to focus most.



{title: Small update, repository switch, etc.}

Time to refresh news section :). We switched to 
{link:Subversion|http://subversion.tigris.org} as repository management tool
giving us what we missed in cvs and most important, less nagging of sourceforge staff for
repository fixes and cleanups. All cvs history is preserved so if you
need something done before, feel free to look at it. Details about usage,
browsing, etc. can be found at {link:download | /page/download} page.

There has been small changes to this site too, with possibility to be continued. So if you
find some odd behaviors on some of pages, it means someone is working on it :).
