Explains what is here
=====================

This folder contains an experimental file chooser dialog that should
be replacement for FLTK's fl_file_chooser().

The plan is to add support for icon themes, some more capability
than fl_file_chooser() have and etc.

To compile it, make sure to have FLTK and edelib source. Then copy
"file-chooser" directory in edelib source tree (before that you should
run "./autogen.sh" and "./configure" in edelib source tree).

After that, in file-chooser directory execute "jam" and you should get
"file_chooser" binary.

Of course, it is not ready to be useful.
