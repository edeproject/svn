ede-meminfo-daemon documentation
================================

ede-meminfo-daemon is a simple daemon tool that collects memory status
and sends it via D-BUS.

Options
-------

--no-daemon::
	Do not run in background.

Details
-------

ede-meminfo-daemon will try to read '/proc/meminfo' and parse needed fields.
Then will broadcast 'org.equinoxproject.Meminfo(double memtotal, double memfree)'
signal via '/org/equinoxproject/Meminfo' object, doing it every 5 seconds (default).

Because ede-meminfo-daemon relies on '/proc/meminfo', available only on Linux, it
only works on this OS.

ede-meminfo-daemon is written in perl and require 'dbus-send' tool (already comes with 
D-BUS package).
