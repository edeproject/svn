 From this file is generated index.html
 and is placed in 'manual' directory. 
 
 Also rest of the html files are generated
 from various places in the tree and put
 in 'manual' too.

 Knowing this, url links should point in
 local directory, not 'manual'.

 Before doing _any_ changes, consulting asciidoc
