Introduction
============

Equinox Desktop Environment or EDE is small desktop environment,
built to be simple and fast.

It is based on concept of separated components, so each of them can
be built, installed and used independently. Of course, full power
of each component comes when they are combined together due many reasons
like communication protocol between each of them.

One of the main goals for EDE is to make desktop environment simple
for usage and as much as possible productive. So, when you start it,
it is already assumed you know 'where things are'. This is accomplished
with familliar look and feel, without needs to learn 'how to start some application'
or how to shutdown environment or computer.

It is based on http://www.fltk.org[FLTK] GUI library with addition of our 
'edelib' library.

EDE also tries to be http://freedesktop.org[freedesktop.org] friendly
following proposed standards; this allows easier integration with other
desktop environments, or their components (counting those that follows
freedesktop.org specifications).
