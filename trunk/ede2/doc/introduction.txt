Introduction
============

Equinox Desktop Environment or EDE is small desktop environment, built to be simple and fast.

EDE has a separated components, so each of them can be built, installed and used independently. 
Of course, the full power comes when they are combined together.

One of the main goals for EDE is to make desktop environment simple for usage and as much as 
possible productive. So, when you start it, it is already assumed you know where the things are. 
This is accomplished with familliar look and feel without needs to learn how to start some application
or how to shutdown environment or computer.

It is based on http://www.fltk.org[FLTK] GUI library with addition of our 'edelib' library.

EDE strives to be http://freedesktop.org[freedesktop.org] friendly following proposed standards. This 
allows easier integration with other desktop environments, their components or data.
