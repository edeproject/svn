- use PtyProcess directly
  * look for (#) signs for progress bar
- new checkbox - "Show options"
  * analyze output from ./configure --help and show options
  * for packages, show "Suggests:" and "Recommends:"
- separate rpm/dpkg/installpkg code into neat classes, so it's easy to add support 
for others
- add support for dependency resolvers (apt-get, urpmi, emerge)
