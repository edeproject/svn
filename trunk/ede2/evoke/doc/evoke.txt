evoke documentation
===================

[NOTE]
.TODO
=====================
Add info about splash themes; reorder document
=====================

evoke is EDE service responsible for starting and quitting desktop, including
all needed prerequisites. Also, it will autostart programs (run programs using
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/autostart-spec[autostart specification])
and behave as http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/xsettings-spec[XSETTINGS] manager.

It is usually started at EDE startup, from 'startede' script and will allow only one instance of 
itself to be running.

Options
-------

-s, --startup::
	Run in starup mode. Startup mode should be used when environment is
	starting and it will read 'ede-startup.conf' file looking for components to
	be started.

-n, --no-splash::
	Do not display splash during startup. Only usefull if in startup mode
	(given '-s' or '--startup').

-d, --dry-run::
	Only useful in startup mode (if '-s' or '--startup' are given). Mainly to test
	splash screen themes

-a, --autostart::
	Run in autostart mode. It will check 'autostart' directory and run .desktop
	files from it. This will be done according to freedesktop.org autostart specification.

-u, --autostart-safe::
	Same as '-a' or '--autostart' option, but display dialog with items that should
	be run.

-c, --config [FILE]::
	Read [FILE] as config file. This file is only used in startup mode to read
	components to be started.

-h, --help::
	This help.


Details
-------

evoke can be started with or without options. If started without options, it will behave
as XSETTINGS manager, reading options from 'ede-settings.conf'.

[NOTE]
.XSETTINGS support
==================================
Not all toolkits supports XSETTINGS protocol; currently only Gtk+ and edelib apps understainds
it (as I know).
==================================

As you can see from options, there are two 'modes' (if parameteres for them are given):

  * autstart mode
  * startup mode

*Autostart mode* is used to run applications from 'autostart' directory. This directory is
usually located at $HOME/.config/autostart or if not exists, in /etc/xdg/autostart. Of course,
both directories can exists and evoke will run applications from both, but with one exception:
if application with the same .desktop name exists in both (and is valid desktop file), it will
be run only from prefered directory, which is $HOME/.config/autostart.

If you want some application to be run at EDE startup (implying evoke is started with '-a' option),
just copy it's .desktop file to autostart directory. Before that, make sure that .desktop file
confirms to http://freedesktop.org specification for Desktop Files.

On other hand if you want to disable running some application from autostart directory, you can
simply delete that file, or set this:
---------------
Hidden = true
---------------
Make sure that 'Hidden' key is under '[Desktop Entry]' section.

Autostart mode can be run in two ways: safe and unsafe. Safe way ('-u' or '--autostart-safe') will
popup window with programs that are 'registered' for starting, from where you can choose either to 
start some of them, start all of them or to start nothing. On other hand, unsafe way ('-a' or '--autostart')
will simply run all 'registered' items without any questioning (should I say that this can be very insecure).

These options are intentionally provided so you can choose startup policy depending on your security
options.

*Startup mode* is meant to be used when EDE is starting, running each component (or program)
from 'ede-startup.conf' (or file specified with '-c' option). This configuration file must be in the following form:
--------------
[Startup]
  # start_order key is used to notify evoke what to start
  # and program keys must be separated with comma (if multiple ones are given)
  start_order = program1, program2, program3 

  # splash_data is directory with icons used for splash screen
  splash_data = /some/path/some_dir_name

# now comes each value from Startup key as separate key
[program1]
  # Icon is icon used in splash screen progress (searched in ImagesDirectory)
  Icon = icon1.png

  # Exec is program executable to be run
  Exec = program1

  # Description is used to describe what is starting
  Description = my cool program

[program2]
  Icon = icon2.png
  Exec = program2
  Description = my cool second program

...
