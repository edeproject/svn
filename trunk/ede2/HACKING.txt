Quick and dirty document for patchers
=====================================

Before sending any type of code patches, make sure to
check a few things:

Tabs
----
Althought we currently does not require specific coding style (aren't we liberate :)
we are very sensitive on tabs. So _use_ them. This will enable not only to us, but
to others, easier switching between screen resolutions etc. (many modern editors allow
setting tab sizes). Also it is much easier to convert tabs to spaces, than otherwise
(if we change opinion to tabs and switch to spaces only). Boring know, but keep it in mind.

eFLTK/FLTK knowledge
--------------------
This is one of the most important things. Make sure you have at least basic understainding of
eFLTK/FLTK, especially for draw() and handle(int) functions. They are very sensitive which
means every move/resize/etc. will call these functions (aka. do not use heavy calculations
inside, reading/writing files etc.)

Memory
------
What you allocate, make sure to deallocate too. Some things should not be deallocated 
explicitly like some eFLTK/FLTK widgets, but for this, check above.

After you read above, applied on code, and decided to send us, please test your code before
sending. Test on everything. Test on power loss, bad food, cold coffee... And, of course
test on speed. If it looks nice, but slow as hell, big as big's mamas house, recosider to
remove these glitches, or if that is not possible, note us like "I want that feature,
have a patch, but it is slooooowww". We will came up with something.

End, for now...
