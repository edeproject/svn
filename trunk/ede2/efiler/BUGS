Known bugs:

- EDE_Browser:
	- Clicking on column header causes the whole header to be moved to 
window x()
	- Resizing any column to the left leaves garbage after the last column
	- Resizing last column to the right can have unexpected results
- If you execute cut, then drag&drop files from another window, cut operation 
will be assumed.
- Callback for tree view widget is erratic - it usually doesn't work on Enter 
key and sometimes it is sufficient to press arrow up or down to enter a 
directory.
- Icon view: sometimes files with @ in name aren't properly aligned
