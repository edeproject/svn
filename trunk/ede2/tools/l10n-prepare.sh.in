This directory contains files with untranslated strings from various EDE programs and
the filename with .pot extension matches the program strings was extracted from.

In case you find some spare time, it would be very nice to help us by translating
these files to your language or validate and update existing translations.

Your contribution is very much appreciated. Thank you advaced!!!
