Readme for EDE 2.0
==================

Please read this document before using or contributing to EDE 2.0 source code.

[NOTE]

===================================

can crash or misbehave
===================================

Build requirements
------------------

EDE 2.0 is using FLTK toolkit from http://www.fltk.org[www.fltk.org]. At the time 
of this writing, latest stable version is 1.3.0.

Since FLTK lacks many things needed for developing a full *nix desktop 
environment, we have developed a small add-on library called 'edelib'. This 
library is also required for compiling EDE 2.0 and should be released together with EDE.

We *strongly* recommend that you use matching versions of ede and 
edelib (e.g. released at the same time) or that you do SVN checkout at the same time due
their frequent changes.

Also you will need a Jam tool. Jam is a make replacement and you can find it on our repository.

Downloading the code
--------------------

The best way to download latest code is checking it out from our repository. These modules
you should checkout (with their paths):

- jam : 'svn co https://ede.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ede/trunk/jam'
- edelib : 'svn co https://ede.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ede/trunk/edelib'
- ede : 'svn co https://ede.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ede/trunk/ede2'

If you already have Jam installed, there is no need to download it.

Compiling and installing
------------------------

In order to build and install EDE do the following steps:

1. compile and install jam first; going to jam source directory and running 'make' will do 
   the job; after that you should get 'bin.YOUR_PLATFORM' directory (on Linux it will be 
   bin.linux) and copy 'jam' executable in your $PATH, e.g. /usr/local/bin

2. compile and install edelib; please read README file in edelib directory

3. go in ede2 directory and run './autogen.sh'

4. after that, goes './configure --enable-debug'

5. jam

6. jam install
