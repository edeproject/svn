Something to read...

First: 
 - all updates should be handled via updatepage.sh

Second:
 - page.py - main script; should be placed in cgi-bin
 - index.html - just redirect to cgi-bin/page.py; should be in root dir
 - htaccess - rewrite rules for page; in root dir too

Third:
 - all stuff use relative positions, so if something is not working
 check relativities in those directories
 - themes archives and screenshots are not on cvs; i'm too lazy to update
 them

See, wasn't too complicated.
