{title: Themes update}

EddieX refreshed themes section with five excelent new themes: {i:EdeAirlock},
{i:EdeDetroit}, {i:EdeOpus3}, {i:EdeOpusBlue} and {i:EdeSmoke}. Make sure to
check them.



{title: Themes}

Themes section is added. This is the latest theme list pulled from cvs module {i:themes}.
If you have proposals or want to make new entry, mail us and we will happily include it.



{title:New page}

Well as you can see new page is uploaded. After messing with css compatibility in various browsers (almost two weeks!)
and testing xhtml 1.0 support, here is the final work. If you have reasonably browser it should look fine. For those
{i: un-reasonably} pieces of code, nothing can be done. Next in TODO lists is to check and update content. 

If you see something that should not be seen or something broken, please mail us or leave message on forum.
