{title: A new distro using EDE}

STX (pronounced: sticks) is a LiveCD distro based on Slackware that has 
chosen Equinox Desktop Environment as its default and only graphical 
environment. This distro in our opinion has a very solid implementation of 
EDE and it's a good way to try out EDE without installing it on your 
computer.

Please remember that this is a very early version and it's still under 
development.

{title: New theme}

Thanks to STIBS, we have new original theme called {i: stx}. This is default
theme for upcoming new version of STX linux distribution. You can find it on 
{link: themes|/page/themes} for download.



{title: 1.0.4 is released}

New version is ready for download. The most important feature is full FreeBSD
support. Among other changes are many fixes for reported bugs and inclusion of 
key configuration tool (ekeyconf). {br:.}

Also it is worth to mention that Vedran did a grunt work to bring this
release,
so all appreciations should go to him. Here is his note: {br:.}{br:.}
<i>"I would like to thank Google Summer of Code for funding my work on 
(among else) EDE 1.0.4. Thanks guys! You rock :) "</i> {br:.}
{i:Vedran}

Currently only source archive is uploaded, but soon should be done the same for
distribution specific packages. Changelog is placed on
{link: this|https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=353280}
link.



{title: Themes update}

EddieX refreshed themes section with five excelent new themes: {i:EdeAirlock},
{i:EdeDetroit}, {i:EdeOpus3}, {i:EdeOpusBlue} and {i:EdeSmoke}. Make sure to
check them.



{title: Themes}

Themes section is added. This is the latest theme list pulled from cvs module {i:themes}.
If you have proposals or want to make new entry, mail us and we will happily include it.



{title:New page}

Well as you can see new page is uploaded. After messing with css compatibility in various browsers (almost two weeks!)
and testing xhtml 1.0 support, here is the final work. If you have reasonably browser it should look fine. For those
{i: un-reasonably} pieces of code, nothing can be done. Next in TODO lists is to check and update content. 

If you see something that should not be seen or something broken, please mail us or leave message on forum.




{title:Package fix}

EDE source package was uploaded with little bug in configure script - it couldn't recognize efltk 2.0.5.
Thanks to Bowman for notice, this is fixed and source package is replaced.




{title:Release 1.0.3}

Today, Friday, April 29, 2005, is nice and sunny day; a perfect day for release. This is mostly bugfix version, and we are 
hoping that you will encounter less crashes and odd behaviors. So, the summary is 1.0.3 version for EDE following 2.0.5
version for efltk. Changelogs are located at {link: link|https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=324135}
for EDE and at {link:link|https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=324136} for efltk.

the next week.
