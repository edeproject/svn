{title: Small update, repository switch, etc.}

Time to refresh news section :). We switched to 
{link:Subversion|http://subversion.tigris.org} as repository management tool
giving us what we missed in cvs and most important, less nagging of sourceforge staff for
repository fixes and cleanups. All cvs history is preserved so if you
need something done before, feel free to look at it. Details about usage,
browsing, etc. can be found at {link:download | /page/download} page.

There has been small changes to this site too, with possibility to be continued. So if you
find some odd behaviors on some of pages, it means someone is working on it :).



{title: A new distro using EDE}

STX (pronounced: sticks) is a LiveCD distro based on Debian/Mepis that has 
chosen Equinox Desktop Environment as its default and only graphical 
environment. This distro in our opinion has a very solid implementation of 
EDE and it's a good way to try out EDE without installing it on your 
computer.

Please remember that this is a very early version and it's still under 
development.
