{title: OSX Panther-like skin}

Ed B. filled themes section with new {i:EDE-Linther} theme. 
{i: It's like OSX Panther, originally a Fluxbox theme} like he said. Excelent
job and refreshing look is our comment.



{title: A new distro using EDE}

STX (pronounced: sticks) is a LiveCD distro based on Debian/Mepis that has 
chosen Equinox Desktop Environment as its default and only graphical 
environment. This distro in our opinion has a very solid implementation of 
EDE and it's a good way to try out EDE without installing it on your 
computer.

Please remember that this is a very early version and it's still under 
development.

{title: New theme}

Thanks to STIBS, we have new original theme called {i: stx}. This is default
theme for upcoming new version of STX linux ditribution. You can find it on 
{link: themes|http://ede.sourceforge.net/page/themes} for download.



{title: 1.0.4 is released}

New version is ready for download. The most important feature is full FreeBSD
support. Among other changes are many fixes for reported bugs and inclusion of 
key configuration tool (ekeyconf). {br:.}

Also it is worth to mention that Vedran did a grunt work to bring this
release,
so all appreciations should go to him. Here is his note: {br:.}{br:.}
<i>"I would like to thank Google Summer of Code for funding my work on 
(among else) EDE 1.0.4. Thanks guys! You rock :) "</i> {br:.}
{i:Vedran}

Currently only source archive is uploaded, but soon should be done the same for
distribution specific packages. Changelog is placed on
{link: this|https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=353280}
link.
