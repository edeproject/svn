{h2: Repository source}

From August, 15 2006, we started to use {link:Subversion|http://subversion.tigris.org/} (or svn) as 
main repository tool. All previous code is still on {link:cvs|http://ede.cvs.sourceforge.net/ede} 
and will be eventually removed. Please, do not use it any more.

To download latest source code from repository, you will need a
{link:subversion|http://subversion.tigris.org/} installed. Most today distributions already ship it
as package, so this should save you from compiling. Documentation about usage can be found on subversion page.

Here is how to checkout each component:

ede:
[[[svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ede/trunk/ede]]]

efltk:
[[[svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ede/trunk/efltk]]]

themes:
[[[svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ede/trunk/themes]]]

or {link: directly browse | http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ede/} it to see what is there.

If you find problems about repository items downloading, fill out 
{link:bug report|http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49891&amp;atid=457858}. Please,
{i: do not} report issues related to subversion (like possible bugs or wrong usage).
They should be directed to subversion {link:developers|http://subversion.tigris.org/}.
