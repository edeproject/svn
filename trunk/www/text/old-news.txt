<news title="1.2 released">
<p>
 This is a bugfix release of EDE and 2.0.7 eFLTK packages (and hopefully the last one of 1.x code and
 the last eFLTK release).
</p>
<p>
 It comes with improved support for 64-bit platforms, redesigned epanelconf and full German and French
 translations, thanks to our contributors. Also big thanks goes to the Zaurus team and users who found
 odd big-endian bug in eFLTK.
</p>
<p>
 Details you can find at 
 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=49891&amp;amp;release_id=554582">EDE</a> and
 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=49891&amp;amp;release_id=554585">eFLTK</a> changelogs
 or at 
 <a href="http://equinox-project.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/query?status=closed&amp;amp;group=resolution&amp;amp;milestone=1.2">
 the finished 1.2 milestone</a>.
</p>
<p>
 From this release, EDE and eFLTK besides the usual way, can be downloaded via 
 <a href="http://equinox-project.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/NetInstall">netinstall</a> script too. Details about
 other download methods you can find at the <a href="http://equinox-project.org/page/download">download</a>
 page.
</p>
<p>
 These releases are planned to retire development of EDE 1.x series and eFLTK, so we can be fully focused on
 FLTK powered EDE 2.0. With the exception of truly critical bugs, all further reported bugs will
 be queued for 2.0 alpha or beta.

<news title="Work update">
<p>
 To show you that we don't sleeping, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20070703161444.GA25814%40stigmata.pmf.unsa.ba&amp;amp;forum_name=ede-devel">here</a> is a small update of the current work on
 2.0 version.
</p>
<p>
 In short, 2.0 will be based on FLTK 1.x due many reasons (details are in above post),
 fully <a href="http://freedesktop.org">freedeskop</a> compliant and much much more :)
</p>
<p>
 In the mean time, there is some preparation for release from 1.x series which
 will mostly try to address some of the current bugs (including infamous gcc 4.x compilation 
 warnings).

<news title="Update...">
<p>
 After a looooong period of laziness in the web space (this can't be
 say for the repository), here is an update with a new, cool stuff.
</p>

<p>
 First of all, as you can see, we have a new domain, equinox-project.org.
 Also, we found a new home for web pages (and tracker, soon) thanks to
 the guys at <a href="http://www.sohlius.com">Sohlius,Inc.</a> (Thanks !!!)
</p>

<p>
 Some pages are probably missing or not updated; this is due current transition,
 so if you see some 404 or 500 errors, you know what is going on :)
</p>

<p>
 Next :) is that we finally got <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#ede">#ede</a> channel at Freenode. 
 This would not be possible without Freenode admins, so a big Thanks! goes to them too. If you
 find some spare time or want to ask or chat about EDE, you know the destination :)
</p>

<p>
 And what was done in the mean time? The best way to find out is to check
 logs at <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ede/">http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ede/</a>
 since they will not definitely fit here (due their size, of course :))

<news title="OSX Panther-like skin">
<p>
 Ed B. filled themes section with new <i>EDE-Linther</i> theme. 
 <i>It's like OSX Panther, originally a Fluxbox theme</i> like he said. Excelent
 job and refreshing look is our comment.

<news title="A new distro using EDE">
<p>
 STX (pronounced: sticks) is a LiveCD distro based on Debian/Mepis that has 
 chosen Equinox Desktop Environment as its default and only graphical 
 environment. This distro in our opinion has a very solid implementation of 
 EDE and it's a good way to try out EDE without installing it on your 
 computer.
</p>
<p>
 Please remember that this is a very early version and it's still under 
 development.

<news title="1.0.4 is released">
<p>
 New version is ready for download. The most important feature is full FreeBSD
 support. Among other changes are many fixes for reported bugs and inclusion of 
 key configuration tool (ekeyconf).
</p>
<p>
 Also it is worth to mention that Vedran did a grunt work to bring this
 release, so all appreciations should go to him. Here is his note:
</p>
<p>
 <i>"I would like to thank Google Summer of Code for funding my work on 
 (among else) EDE 1.0.4. Thanks guys! You rock :) "</i>:Vedran
</p>
<p>
 Currently only source archive is uploaded, but soon should be done the same for

<news title="New page">
<p>
 Well as you can see new page is uploaded. After messing with css compatibility in various browsers (almost two weeks!)
 and testing xhtml 1.0 support, here is the final work. If you have reasonably browser it should look fine. For those
 <i>un-reasonably</i> pieces of code, nothing can be done. Next in TODO lists is to check and update content. 
</p>
