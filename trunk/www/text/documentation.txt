<a name="installation">Installation how-to</a>

There is three ways to install Equinox Desktop Environment. First is to download binary packages for
your distribution, second is to download source tarballs and third is to download it from repository and
compile it. For first option, please consult your's distribution installation system and for other
two, compilation is the same.

Note that EDE require eFLTK (extended FLTK) library. This library is improved FLTK 2.0 
library with many changes and core modifications. To build it, you don't need FLTK 2.0 source, 
eFLTK already incorporate it. You can download it from standard project page.

Here is few steps how to build eFLTK and EDE (EDE will be exactly as you build eFLTK).

<br />

<a name="efltk_build">Building efltk from source</a>

After downloading, unpack it, and run: 

    ./configure

You can check additional options with:

    ./configure --help 

In the usual way, *configure* will build eFLTK with MySQL and unixODBC support.
EDE does not use it, so you can safely disable it. Option: 

    ./configure --disable-mysql --disable-unixODBC will

do the job. eFLTK support xft (font anti-aliasing) too. Building with this option EDE will have it too. Xft in older
X versions, especially in XFree86 was very buggy and in that case the best way is to leave it. On other hand, newer
distributions ships with X.org's server, that have very good xft support. In that case, command:

    ./configure --enable-xft

will happily include it.

If you find spare time and decide to help us, proposal way is to build eFLTK and EDE with debug support. This 
will create bigger and slower executable files, but in the case of odd behaviors and crashing output will be
more descriptive which will enable us easily finding the bugs.

    ./configure --enable-debug

is that option.

After configure do it's job, running: 

    make

will start the compilation process. Time spending in it depends on
processor's speed. When it is done, installation (as root) goes with: 

    make install

<br />

<a name="ede_build">Building EDE from source</a>

EDE building is the same as for eFLTK, except for *configure* options. Debugging is usually supported with 

   ./configure --enable-debug
   
flag. Other flags are:

   ./configure --disable-silent
   
which will remove those *Compiling something...* console output string, replacing with full compiler command 
line. This can be very useful (for debugging too) in case compiler starts to act weird. Classical 

   make
   
and 

   make install

after configure finished will place EDE where should be.

Last option left to be done is to place in your's local *.xinitrc* file 

   startede
   
line. This will invoke script with the same name which will start various programs that are part of desktop 
environment. Command 

   startx

will start X server and pull commands from your's *.xinitrc* file.

<a name="theming">Theming how-to</a>

As can be seen, EDE supports themes and window decorations. 

Each theme contain few XPM images and text **default.theme* file, which describes window manager how theme
should look. Here is example of default.theme file:

   [Theme]
		Frame color=RGB(129,153,177)
		Title image=title.xpm
		Close image up=close.xpm
		Close image down=closeD.xpm
		Maximize image up=max.xpm
		Maximize image down=maxD.xpm
		Minimize image up=min.xpm
		Minimize image down=minD.xpm

**Frame color** describes color that will left, right and bottom window frames use. If you ask yourself about top
frame, don't worry, **Title image** variable will fill it.

**RGB(129, 153, 177)** describes percent of red, green and blue color respectively. So here we have 
red = 129, green = 153 and blue = 177.  With combination of these basic three colors you can get various color schemes.

**Title image** is ordinary XPM image that will be used to decorate window title. It will be tiled (remember this !).

**Close image up** will be use to decorate close button; button placed on top-right window frame. This 
variable describe how close button will look when you don't press it.

**Close image down** same as above, except that this image will be used when mouse press button.

**Maximize image up**, **Maximize image down**, **Minimize image up** and **Minimize image down**,
do (guess :)) like described for **Close** button.
