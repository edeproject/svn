<news title="EDE 2.0 alpha released">
<p>
 We are pleased to announce the first, major 2.0 EDE release, we are working
 on for the last tree years. 
</p>

<p>
 There is a lot of the new stuff and code, but the most important are replacing 
 eFLTK usage with <a href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK</a>, introducing our
 brand new edelib library and syncing with the
 <a href="http://freedesktop.org">fredesktop.org</a> standards.

<p>
 Please note how this is still alpha release meant for those who would like to
 contribute to the project.
