<news title="gcc 4.3.2 patch">
<p>
 Thierry, from <a href="http://www.nutyx.org/">Nutyx</a> project, completed
 a long standing eFLTK patch for the newer gcc version(s). Currently a patch
 is located <a href="http://equinox-project.org/patches/gcc432.patch">here</a>
 and I'm hoping to apply it on the svn soon.
</p>

<p>
 You can see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2633352&amp;forum_id=249614">

<news title="EDE got review, slashdotted, news repost and the rest...">
<p>
 As we get noted by our hosting provider, they did some significant hardware
 upgrade which required data moving and etc. (that includes this site too).
 ...and during that move, some news I posted are lost ;-(, so this is a second
 try (with backup, of course).
</p>
<p>
 EDE was reviewed by <a href="http://www.linux.com">linux.com</a> team
 and you can find it at <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/135684">this
 link</a>. This got on <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/05/26/1643222">
 slashdot</a> too!!! :-)
</p>
<p>
 Also, Trac (wiki and tracker) is now up. There are some small changes that needs to
 be reconfigured due this backup/move/restore but that should not be an issue
 (hopefully ;-)).
