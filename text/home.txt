{title: Small update, repository switch, etc.}

Time to refresh news section :). We switched to 
{link:Subversion|http://subversion.tigris.org} as repository management tool
enabling us it's benefits and most important, less nagging of sourceforge staff for
repository fixes. Is someone interests, all cvs history is preserved so if you
need something done before, feel free to look at it. Details about usage,
browsing etc. can be found at {link:/page/download | download} page.

There has been small changes to site too with possible continuity. So if you
find some odd behaviors on some of pages, it means someone is working on it :).



{title: A new distro using EDE}

STX (pronounced: sticks) is a LiveCD distro based on Debian/Mepis that has 
chosen Equinox Desktop Environment as its default and only graphical 
environment. This distro in our opinion has a very solid implementation of 
EDE and it's a good way to try out EDE without installing it on your 
computer.

Please remember that this is a very early version and it's still under 
development.

support. Among other changes are many fixes for reported bugs and inclusion of 
key configuration tool (ekeyconf). {br:.}

Also it is worth to mention that Vedran did a grunt work to bring this
release,
so all appreciations should go to him. Here is his note: {br:.}{br:.}
<i>"I would like to thank Google Summer of Code for funding my work on 
(among else) EDE 1.0.4. Thanks guys! You rock :) "</i> {br:.}
{i:Vedran}
